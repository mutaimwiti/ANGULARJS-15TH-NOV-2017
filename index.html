        <!--
            AngularJS uses HTML as the template language. AngularJS adds its own specific elements and attributes.
            It combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic view that the
            user sees on the browser. Example: ng-app="" directive starts an AngularJS Application. </div> marks the
            end of the application.
        -->
        <div ng-app="">
            <!--
                ng-model directive creates a "model variable" named name, which can be used with the HTML page and within
                the div having ng-app directive.
            -->
            <p>What's your Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
            <!--
                ng-bind then uses the name model to be displayed in the HTML <span> tag whenever user enters input in
                the text box
            -->
            <p>Hello <span ng-bind="name"></span>&nbsp;:)</p>
        </div>
        <!--
